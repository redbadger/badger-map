# Badger Map

Where do Badgers live?

[**Here is the map**](https://redbadger.github.io/badger-map)

## Why

Now we're all remote, it could be useful to see who are the nearby badgers to you.

## How

If you wish to participate, you have two options:

- let me know your postcode on slack (@charypar)
- Add yourself into [this spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1U_mjJv-3xlxfx1R1-f6eJY5UjWbDEVevu_oCziy4a4I/edit)

You can rightclick any position on the map to figure out your latitude/longitude.

## Running locally

The simplest way of running this locally for development without any additional
tools is using Python:

```sh
python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8000
```

Then you can open <http://localhost:8000> and everything should work.

## I'd like my own map please

This is a little more complicated than I'd like, but it's doable with a little
effort. There are a couple pre-requisites:

1. Your organisation uses Google's G-Suite
2. You can create a project in your organisation's developer console and attach
   a billing account (sadly, the necessary Google APIs are not free of charge).

### The overall architecture

...if it can be called that. The map is a completely static web page. Everything
dynamic happens in the browser. It is deployed using [Github pages]() because it's
the easiest way with no additional tooling.

The data is coming from a google spreadsheet shared with everyone in the
organisation. The sharing preferences double as authorization for access to
people's location information, so that only members of the organisation can
see where people live.

The page uses the following Google services:

\*Â [Maps JS API]() to... well, draw the map

- [Spreadsheets read-only API]() to load data from the spreadsheet
- [Authentication](), in order to access the spreadsheet API on behalf of the
  person looking at the page

The JavaScript code on the page first start an authentication flow and when
successful, fetches the data from the spreadsheet, as a collection of rows and
creates markers on the map.

### Set up the spreadsheet

The spreadsheet needs to have four columns:

```
Name, Latitude, Longitude, Slack handle
```

Next, mark the range where the data will go, and in the menu under "Data" select
Named Ranges, add one and name it "People" (this is what the code assumes).

Set the sharing settings to "anyone within organisation can find and edit"

### Create the google project and get API key

This is the trickiest part of the set up. You may want to make a cup of tea.

First, open the [Google Developers Console](https://console.developers.google.com/).

You'll need to create a new project: At the top right, open the project picker
and choose "New Project", name your project and for all further steps, make
sure the project is selected.

Next, from the hamburger menu, select "Billing". You'll either need to create
a billing account, or have management access to one that exists. Choose the
right organisation from the drop-down and switch to the "my projects" tab. Find
the project you just created and click the kebab menu (the three dots on the
very right) and select change billing. Pick the right billing account and confirm
with "Set Account". You can now use paid APIs.

Now we need to enable the right APIs to be used. In the hamburger menu, under
"APIs & Services", click "Library". Search for and add the following:

- Google Sheets API
- Maps JavaScript API

You will need to go into each APIs page and click "Enable".

Finally, we need to generate a set of credentials to allow access. Once again in
the hamburger menu, pick "Api & Services" and "Credentials". At the top of the
screen, click "Create Credentials" and select "API key". Note down the key, you'll
need it later on. You should also restrict the key immediately. Use the "HTTP
Referrers" restriction and put in the URL of your site (e.g. `http://my-page.github.io`)
and `http://localhost:8000`). Additionally, restrict the key to access the two
APIs we just enabled (just in case you later add more).

Get baack to the credentials screen and create another credential, this time
an OAuth Client ID. This will let us do things on behalf of the users. Pick "Web
Application" and put the same two URLs as above as "Authorised JavaScript origins".
Note down the Client ID at the top right.

### Set up the deployment pipeline
